A React app to render data from my solar inveter. 

This project started out as a way to play with Chat GPT and see how much I could get it to do given some basic inputs of the API endpoint and an expected response object. The results were beyond my expectation, as the AI bot proceeded to give me everything I needed to render a basic React app that hit the endpoint via a proxy server (to get around CORS issues) and render the response on screen. What followed was further refinement of this and debugging of various issues encoutered, but after a couple of hours of back and forth with very little intervention on my part, I had a function application complete with date picker, totalling logic in the scrollable table, and a graph to plot the data in the response. Bonkers!
